# COMP2150  - Level Design Document
### Name: Phoebe Johns

Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

## 1. Player Experience

### 1.1. Discovery

![Breakable walls after picking up staff](DocImages/discovery1.png) ![First enemy encounter](DocImages/discovery2.png)

The first encounter after picking up the staff involves two breakable columns. It is important to provide the player with a playground to experiment with and understand new mechanics before they are tested on them. This is a philosophy that I tried my best to cling to when designing this level and its sections. The next thing the player will see after breaking the columns is an enemy. This encounter lets the player prove they can handle combat before having to combine it with platforming, more enemies, or other mechanics.

Every main section and new mechanic follows a simple design formula. First the player is introduced to the mechanic or mechanics in a safe, experimental environment. After the introductory encounter, a series of developments on those ideas are presented. Each of these encounters present new combinations of established ideas to encourage the player to explore how they can interact with the mechanic. After the player has explored several ideas and approaches regarding a specific mechanic, they reach a ‘final exam’ that tests both their knowledge and execution of the mechanics they have learned. Each of the three main sections crescendo in these final exam encounters, with each section posing a greater challenge than the last.

### 1.2. Drama

What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 
This process of learning mechanics and building on ideas, as well as the use of the ‘final exam’ design philosophy serves to create a satisfying dramatic arc over the course of the level. In this way, each section serves as a complete dramatic arc of its own with its own peaks and troughs to keep the player in the flow channel as described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. 

Each section concludes with a wind-down in intensity; the player isn’t immediately out of danger after completing the final exam of a section. The danger in these wind-down segments is low, but prevents a jarring drop in the intensity of the level. These sections, always immediately following the final exam, act as one final moment of tension before there can be resolution. They serve the same purpose as the final chord in a piece of music before the resolution, before the cadence is complete. This serves to sweeten and emphasise the relief that the player feels when finally reaching that checkpoint - when finally collecting that key.

### 1.3. Challenge

There are two main types of challenge in my level: combat and platforming. Both of these types of challenge are taught to the player separately at first and are gradually combined to create interesting encounters. Each encounter serves as development on something that came before. The most challenging encounters in this level are those that combine the mechanics of platforming and combat, requiring the player to balance their priorities and multitask. 
Players usually have the freedom to choose how they approach an encounter in how they choose to balance their focus between platforming and combat. Some players may choose to defeat every enemy they see as to make platforming easier, while others may put their efforts into evading and manoeuvring around enemies and projectiles. To encourage the player to engage with both systems, certain encounters are staged to heavily favour one approach over another, to give the player practice in all of the game's systems. This also gives them a chance to experiment with different play styles so that by the final exam segments they can have the freedom to express how they wish to play.

### 1.4. Exploration

My level design makes liberal use of background tiles and surrounding geometry as tools to inform the feeling of each space and encounter. Despite all sections of the level sporting the same tileset and assets, contrasting spaces and feelings can be created through the use of background tiles, ceilings and stalactite formations. Using both positive and negative spaces to convey context and levels of comfort/danger to the player serves to create feelings in players that drive them forward through the level. 

Throughout the level there are several little platforms or ledges off the beaten path that the player can choose to investigate. While the topological structure of the level is very linear, small offshoots such as these offer the player a sense of freedom of exploration. The player is usually rewarded for their efforts with one or two heart pickups, which serve as an incentive to explore these offshoots when they see them again. The frequency of these optional heart pickups means that if the player is struggling for health, they can modify their playstyle to focus more on searching and collecting these heart refills.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words, 36 per element)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3. Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4. Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

## Generative AI Use Acknowledgement

Use the below table to indicate any Generative AI or writing assistance tools used in creating your document. Please be honest and thorough in your reporting, as this will allow us to give you the marks you have earnt. Place any drafts or other evidence inside this repository. This form and related evidence do not count to your word count.
An example has been included. Please replace this with any actual tools, and add more as necessary.


### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
